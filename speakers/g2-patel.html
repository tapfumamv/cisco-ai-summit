    <div class="narrative-section" id="s1" data-section="s1">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">01</span> Three constraints holding AI back</div>
      <p>Jeetu Patel took the stage with a joke  -  "I have no idea what we're going to do next year with the lineup"  -  before cutting straight to the framework that would anchor every conversation that followed. AI, he argued, faces <strong>three major constraints</strong>. First: <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span>. There simply isn't enough power, compute, network bandwidth, and memory to satiate AI's appetite, and the industry is spending trillions to close the gap. Second: the <span class="highlight">trust deficit</span> that Chuck Robbins had just introduced  -  the fact that if people don't trust AI systems, they'll never use them. And third: a <span class="highlight">data gap</span>. The public internet's supply of human-generated training data is running out. Synthetic data and machine-generated data from agents working 24/7 are filling the void, but this creates its own new dynamics. Three constraints, each enormous, each interconnected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s2" data-section="s2">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">02</span> Token generation as national currency</div>
      <p>Patel then delivered what may have been the summit's most provocative economic thesis. "Token generation is going to be one of the core currencies of every company and every country," he declared, "because your ability to economically and efficiently generate tokens will be directly proportionate to <strong>national security</strong> as well as to economic prosperity." This wasn't hyperbole dressed as strategy  -  it was a reframing of AI infrastructure as geopolitical imperative. And Patel didn't stop at data centers: token generation, he argued, must happen at the edge too. Latency-sensitive applications can't afford round trips to centralized facilities. Cisco's answer was a <span class="highlight">unified edge architecture</span> that distributes inference processing across branches and edge locations, ensuring that wherever tokens need to be generated, the infrastructure is ready.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s3" data-section="s3">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">03</span> AI writing its own code</div>
      <p>The most striking proof point came from Cisco's own engineering floor. Patel revealed that <strong>70% of all code in Cisco's AI products is now generated by AI</strong>  -  a number that sounded far-fetched just a year earlier. And by the end of 2026, at least half a dozen Cisco products will have 100% of their code written by AI. Humans aren't being removed from the loop, Patel was careful to note  -  they're writing specifications and reviewing output. But the bottleneck has fundamentally shifted. It's no longer about <em>writing</em> code; it's about <strong>reading and reviewing</strong> it. This subtle inversion captures the broader shift happening across knowledge work: AI is accelerating the use of AI, creating a compounding cycle that makes the constraints he'd outlined earlier feel even more urgent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s4" data-section="s4">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">04</span> Security as prerequisite, not afterthought</div>
      <p>Patel drew a line that reframed the entire security conversation. Historically, enterprises faced a choice: be secure or be productive. Those were "offsets of each other." But with AI, the dynamic has flipped. <strong>If people don't trust these systems, they'll never use them.</strong> Security isn't optional  -  it's the prerequisite for adoption. This is why Cisco launched AI Defense the previous year and why companies like CVS and NEC were now deploying it in production. Patel also announced that Cisco was building its own foundation security models and open-sourcing them  -  a move aimed at making AI security economically viable across the ecosystem. The message to the room's CISOs was pointed: securing AI isn't just using AI for cyber defense; it's <span class="highlight">securing AI itself</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-card">
      <div class="label">Key Insight</div>
      <p>The bottleneck in AI-powered software development has inverted: it's no longer about <strong>writing code</strong>  -  it's about <strong>reading and reviewing</strong> it. As AI generates more of the code, the human role shifts from production to judgment, specification, and quality assurance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s5" data-section="s5">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">05</span> The paradox of progress</div>
      <p>Patel's most nuanced observation came near the end of his keynote: a <span class="highlight">"paradox of progress"</span> that he asked the audience to sit with. On one hand, AI is solving harder problems every single day. On the other, organizations are struggling to articulate concrete impact and ROI consistently across their operations. The technology is advancing faster than organizations have the capacity to absorb it. This isn't a technology problem  -  it's a <strong>change management problem</strong>, a cultural problem, a human problem. And Patel was candid: "Just building bigger faster technology that doesn't actually keep in mind how that technology can be absorbed is not really going to get us what we need." It was an unusually honest admission from the CPO of a company that sells that very infrastructure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>"AI is moving at a pace much faster than organizations have the capacity to absorb it. That's actually something that has to get solved for."</p>

    </div>

    <div class="narrative-section" id="s6" data-section="s6">
      <div class="section-label"><span class="num">06</span> The hard questions ahead</div>
      <p>Rather than ending with answers, Patel ended with questions  -  and that was the point. Where will AI ROI come from  -  efficiency gains, or solving previously unsolvable problems? In an increasingly nationalistic world, is <strong>sovereignty more important than raw intelligence</strong>? Will language models alone get us to AGI, or do we need physical AI and large world models? What does the "ChatGPT moment" for robotics look like? These weren't rhetorical flourishes. They were the exact questions the rest of the summit's speakers would spend the day grappling with. Patel had built the frame; now it was time to hand the stage to the builders  -  starting with the man who started it all, Sam Altman.</p>
